What are functions in JavaScript, How do you declare them ?

1. A function (also known as a method) is a self-contained piece of code that performs a particular "function".

2. A function is a reusable code-block that will be executed by an event,or when the function is called.
 
3. You may call a function from anywhere within the page (or even from other pages if the function is embedded in an external .js file).
