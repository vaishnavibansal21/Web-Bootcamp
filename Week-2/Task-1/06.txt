What is the difference between var,let and const in javascript ?

var :
1.var declarations are either globally scoped or function-scoped.
2.its prefer not to use var bcoz of issue in block scope and functional scope. 

let :
1.let variables can be updated but not re-declared. 
2.let allows the variable to be reassigned multiple times. 

const : 
1.const variables cannot be updated but re-declared. 
2.const creates a variable allows that cannot be reassigned after it has been assigned a value.
